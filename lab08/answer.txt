1. 32 bytes; TLB misses usually>=4, Page fault usually>= 4; 10 30 50 70 90 10 30 50 70 90; at first access we loop it up on TLB, miss, go to page table, page faults, OS allocates memory for it, fill Page table, fill TLB.

2. See above. 

3. Make physical memory larger such that it could contain >= 5 pages. This time page fault will be reduced to 5.

4. Four processes are accessing the memory at the same time, and each time a process exits from sleep the TLB has to be set up again, unlike the previous single-process case where PT is not cleared when running. Solution is to store TLB for every process.
