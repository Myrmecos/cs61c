1. I really enjoy my experience living in the hall for the past semesters. I like the community-like, friendly atmosphere and the everyday interactions with hallmates and hall staff;
2. I'm a non-local student with no relatives in Hong Kong. Residence in the hall provides great support for me, allowing me to be more devoted to my schoolwork.
3. Hall experience provides opportunities to get involved in a variety of student activities, allowing me to embrace a more integrative and outward-looking mindset;
4. Thanks to my past residence experience, I was able to start my first club (Nature and Wilderness Club) at the residential hall. This was an invaluable experience as I learned about how to organize activities and promote fellow club members' interests in Hong Kong's local wildlife. I hope to organize similar activities if I could be given the chance to reside in a hall in the coming year.
